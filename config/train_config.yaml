# Main configuration file for Hydra.
# This is the entry point for all configuration management.
# Specific configs are organized in subdirectories.

# Defaults - these are applied in order
defaults:
  - override hydra/hydra_logging: none
  - override hydra/job_logging: none

# Model configuration
model:
  name: "convnext_tiny_cbam"
  num_classes: 5
  pretrained: true
  cbam_stages: [3, 4]

# Loss function configuration
loss:
  type: "focal_loss"
  alpha: "dynamic"  # "dynamic" to compute from class frequencies, or float value
  gamma: 2.5  # Increased from 2.0 - more aggressive focusing on hard examples
  reduction: "mean"

# Data configuration
data:
  img_dir: "data/images"
  ann_dir: "data/annotations"
  batch_size: 16  # Stable batch size for this GPU
  num_workers: 4  # Parallel data loading

# Augmentation configuration
augmentation:
  horizontal_flip: 0.5
  vertical_flip: 0.5
  # rotation: disabled - could move defects outside visible area
  brightness_contrast:
    brightness: 0.3  # Increased from 0.2 - more variety for rare classes
    contrast: 0.3    # Increased from 0.2
